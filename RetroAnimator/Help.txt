General tips & features
-------------------------------
- Retroanimator will load into the Parts list (left) every image you have in the folder you've saved your project (or any subfolders). The list auto updates while the program is open if you add, move, rename or remove images from the folder (note: renaming, moving or removing images/parts if you're already using them in a frame or animation will greet you with an error, this will be fixed in a later build, at least for moving parts into subfolders). 
- You can freely tweak with an external program the images you've loaded while RetroAnimator is open and they will be auto updated. (note: changing their size might require to reposition them).
- In general most things work with drag&drop: 
a) Drag & drop a part from the Parts list into the canvas (middle area) granted you've got a frame selected (Frames list). The part placed will be added to the top of the frame's Sprites list.
b) Drag & drop parts within the Sprites list to rearrange them/change their order (lower parts render below others).
c) Drag & drop a frame from the Frames list into the Timeline (bottom), granted you've got an animation selected (Animations list).
d) You can move one or multiple parts within the canvas if you click and drag them (for more precise movement see below, using WASD keys).
e) Drag & drop a frame within the Timeline  to rearrange it (selecting and rearranging multiple frames at the same time within the Timeline will come in a later build).
